**** SECURITY WARNING FOR PAST security/easy-rsa versions ****
**** easyrsa may have encrypted your CA private key with a weak cipher

Per CVE-2024-13454, Easy-RSA 3.0.5 inclusively up to and including 3.1.7,
when used with OpenSSL 3, may have accidentally encrypted the CA private
key with a weak cipher, des-ede3-cbc, instead of the intended aes-256-cbc,
when a CA was created with the   easyrsa build-ca   command.

Such mistakes cannot be corrected by upgrading Easy-RSA alone.

The standing recommendation for CA private keys is to 
re-encrypt the CA privat keys with the aes-256-cbc cipher,
by using the   easyrsa set-pass ca   command.
