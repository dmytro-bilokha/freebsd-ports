This is my fork of the FreeBSD Ports Collection. Here I keep all my ports which have not been accepted to the main FreeBSD Ports Collection.
Deviations with upstream are:
- Added www/tomee-plus port of [TomEE Plus](https://tomee.apache.org/) edition, [patch](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=258438) has been sent to upstream.
- Added devel/py-intelhex port of a [library with scripts](https://github.com/python-intelhex/intelhex) to work with Intel HEX files, [patch](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=260204) has been sent to upstream.
